          My final year internship (and now I work with working contract) took place in a French IT service company located in Montpellier.
          My mission was to research, modeling and develop a Rich Client prototype for company's current business and project
          management software "IOvision". Instructed by lead system engineer and worked with other colleagues, I successfully
          implemented the prototpe by using AngularJS Framework with different front-end technologies and JEE Web Services
          validated by unit testing. Besides, I regularly participated in prototype's validation checkpoints and meetings.
          Note:I am not in a position to present any detailed information, including but not limiting to application core
          features, business strategic plans and product details.

        <header>Module analysis & technology choosing</header>
        <p>
          During the phase of module analysis(A sub module of "Commercial-contact"), I worked with "IOvision"'s' project manager and
          the senior system engineer to discover and research its fonctionnalities. Business suite "IOvision" is a small
          business ERP for commerce, project, HR and internal affaires management, which includes 6 main modules, hundreds
          of tables and fonctionalities.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to estalish a scalable web application, we have chosen AngularJS as its front-end Framework, which is extendible,
          flexible, easy-to-use and well architectured especially dedicated to develop large size web application, for example
          its MVVM design pattern, idea of dependency injection, directives, ease of testing etc.. This architecture change
          makes this small business ERP move towards to philosophy "Front-end focused"(such as ergonomy, graphique, business
          logic, web services) and ease the "tight coupling" from traditional MVC model.
        </p>



        <p>
          Since "IOvision" is commercial and is protected by copyright, I'm not in a position to reveal its main fonctionalities and
          system details. Instead, I will just show some product screenshots at a glance.

        <header>Architecture design and front-end implementation with framework AngularJS</header>

        <img src="images/details_images/iovision_05.jpg" width="120" align="right" style="margin-top:10px" />
        <p>
          After we have decided to use AngularJS as main front-end framework, instructed by lead system engineer, I developed and established
          the architecture of the prototype, included but not limited to AngularJS modules(Controller, services, directives
          and filters), HTML modules, CSS modules and third-party integration such as grunt server and bower. For unit testing,
          I used Jasmine to cover the code and I reached 95% coverage of AngularJS modules.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technically, I used Grunt Server and bower to manage third-party Javascripts components and front-end plugins, and JS utilities
          such as underscroeJS and d3js/nvd3, jQplot(abandonned) to generate dashboard components. Concerning about AngularJS,
          I used third-party vendors such as AngularUI, AngularBoostrap, AngularStrap to generate components like grid/table
          components. Besides, during the project I broadly used "Dependency injection", "Routage", "Factory & Services",
          "Events & Exception", "Promise" in Angularjs and self-defined directives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, I participated regularly the validation checkpoints and meetings with project manager and system engineers to
          discuss and follow the work progress. The project is putted on Git and I got many significant experience of team-working
          after my supervisor's checking codes and quality assurance. Besides, I follow and manage my tasks on company's
          internal task management platform "Redmine".

        <header>Developement of JEE web service and Integration with current ERP's Framework "ILoa"</header>
        <div class="image" style="clear:both">

          <p>
            The original ERP's architecture was invented and implemented by 2 senior system engineers in 2003 which is called "ILoa",
            a similar JSP MVC Model2 but with improved datastore and tag technologies.
          </p>

          <div class="image" style="clear:both">
            <div class="project_show_image" style="float:left">
              <a href="images/details_images/iovision_04.jpg" class="highslide" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">

              <div>Brief Intro of system architecture</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            As ERP "IOvision" has been used and established for about 10 years, changing all its backend infrastructure (like change
            to Spring and Hibernate integration) is impossible and not allowed by the budget. What my principle mission was
            to add and integrate a new JEE Web service layer to communicate with front-end reliazation (RESTFul services).
            Instructed by my supervisor and worked with founder of framework ILoa, I successfully added a layer of JEE Web
            service (Tomcat+SVN+Maven, by using JAX-RS, JAXB, Jackson..) with AngularJS integration. For persistence issues,
            it's easy to call ILOA's persistence module funtions and it will automatically integrate with Sybase database.

        <div class="image" style="clear:both">

          <p>
            During my internship, the prototype runs great and has already been shown to many clients. For the moment, I work as an employee
            and continue the protptype with a deeper integration with the nowadays system. Within the intense work of this
            6-months' internship, I came through with valuable experiences in Front-end MVC(MVVM) technologies and unit testings
            skills, along with HTML5/CSS/Web page construction, small business ERP system module analysis, SOA design, JEE
            Web Service, Java programming skills and a deep understanding of SOA & RESTFul methods.
