            <p>During this short-time project our group realised a functional university source planning system based on .NET MVC4 technology. I provided all web api programming and testing works and 2 parts of CMS. (reservation and courses management).            </p>

              <p>
              Based on the previous result of java version CMS, we have re-built the project with .Net version. The final result include reservation, course, teacher, class and time scheduling management. During the project, I wrote all Web APIs using .Net MVC framework and realized 2 main parts of system: course and reservation management.

				<p>As our project is based on the product (java version) that we have realized, we have decided to rebulid the system without changing our database. And for a limited group member of 4, we have finally chosen .NET MVC 4 as our fast-pace development framework. .NET MVC Framework also has a confortable ORM framework: EntityFramework and an easy REST Web Service which allows us to fastly extend our business.
				During the starting phase of our project, I participated and involved in technology choosing decision.</p>

                    <p>
						The implementation contains 3 parts: UI, Web application and Web Service (Web API). I was responsible for .NET Web API development and testing works. Also I realized 2 parts (CRUD) of system under .Net MVC Framework. 
						For API and Web application development, I used .Net Entity Framework as method that manipulates SQL Server database.
                    </p>

					  After a 2 months' intense development, our team of 4 realized all functionalities that we expected to develop and realized main Web APIs for future extension of our project. I established a general sense of .NET Framework and practiced a lot of using MVC design pattern . Final Doucmentation and links is <a href="https://github.com/chenyang/UVSP">here</a>.
